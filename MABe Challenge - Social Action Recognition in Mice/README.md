## 🎯 Competition Overview

### Background

Animal social behavior is complex. Species from ants to wolves to mice form social groups where they build nests, raise their young, care for their groupmates, and defend their territory. Studying these behaviors teaches us about the brain and the evolution of behavior, but the work has usually required subjective, time-consuming documentation of animals' actions. ML advancements now let us automate this process, supporting large-scale behavioral studies in the wild and in the lab.

### Challenge

This competition challenges you to build models to identify **over 30 different social and non-social behaviors** in pairs and groups of co-housed mice, based on markerless motion capture of their movements in top-down video recordings. The dataset includes:

- **400+ hours** of footage
- **20+ behavioral recording systems**
- **Frame-by-frame expert annotations**

### Impact

Your work will help scientists automate behavior analysis and better understand animal social structures. These models may be deployed across numerous labs in:
- 🧠 Neuroscience
- 🧬 Computational Biology
- 🐾 Ethology
- 🌍 Ecology

## 💡 Solution Approach

### Core Strategy

My solution tackles the MABe challenge by building **separate GBDT ensemble models for each unique `body_parts_tracked` configuration**:

1. **Grouped by Tracker**: Loop through each unique `body_parts_tracked` string
2. **FPS-Aware Features**: Generate advanced temporal and spatial features with window sizes scaled by video's FPS for time-invariant features
3. **Stratified Subsampling**: Use `StratifiedSubsetClassifier` wrapper to train GBDTs on stratified subsamples to manage memory and time
4. **Ensemble Model**: For each behavior, train an ensemble of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models
5. **Adaptive Prediction**: Use temporal smoothing, adaptive per-action probability thresholds, and minimum duration filtering to generate final event segments

### Key Innovations

- 🌊 **Wavelet Transform Features** - Multi-scale frequency analysis
- ⚡ **Physics-Informed Features** - Jerk, angular velocity, kinetic energy
- 🔄 **Transition Detection Features** - Behavior onset/offset detection
- 🎯 **Enhanced Pair Interaction Features** - Bearing, time-to-collision
- 📈 **Relative Physics Features** - Relative velocity, acceleration

# Angular velocity (rotation detection)
angular_vel = dθ/dt

# Kinetic energy proxy
KE = speed²

# Centripetal acceleration (circling behavior)
centripetal = speed × angular_velocity
```

#### NEW: Wavelet Features

```python
# Multi-scale frequency decomposition
coeffs = pywt.wavedec(speed, 'db4', level=4)

# Features extracted:
- wavelet_energy_L{0-4}     # Energy at each decomposition level
- wavelet_low_freq_mean     # Slow movement patterns
- wavelet_high_freq_mean    # Fast movement patterns

```

#### NEW: Transition Detection

```python
# Z-score of speed vs local context
speed_zscore = (speed - local_mean) / local_std

# Change point detection
speed_change = future_mean - past_mean

# Autocorrelation (rhythmic behaviors like grooming)

#### NEW: Relative Physics Features

```python
# Relative velocity between mice
rel_speed = |v_A - v_B|

# Relative acceleration
rel_acc = |a_A - a_B|
