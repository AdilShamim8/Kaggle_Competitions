## 🎭 The Challenge

> **In a world where AI-generated text is becoming indistinguishable from human writing, your mission is clear: Hunt down the impostors!**

This Kaggle competition puts your NLP skills to the ultimate test. Given a piece of text, can your model determine if it was crafted by a human or generated by an AI? It's a digital game of Among Us, but with words! 🚀

### 🎯 Objective

Build a binary classifier that can accurately detect:

| Label | Meaning |
|:-----:|:--------|
| ✅ **Real** | Authentic human-written text |
| 🤖 **Fake** | AI-generated impostor text |

## 🚀 My Approach

```
📊 Data Loading ──► 🧹 Preprocessing ──► 🔬 Feature Engineering ──► 🤖 Model Training ──► 🎯 Prediction
```

### 🧠 The Strategy

| Step | What I Did | Why It Matters |
|:----:|:-----------|:---------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Text Cleaning** | Removed noise, normalized text | 
| 2️⃣ | **Smart Tokenization** | Captured linguistic patterns |
| 3️⃣ | **Feature Extraction** | TF-IDF + Custom features |
| 4️⃣ | **Model Ensemble** | Combined multiple models for robustness |
| 5️⃣ | **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Squeezed out every bit of performance |
